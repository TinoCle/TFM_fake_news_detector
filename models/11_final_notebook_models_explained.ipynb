    "## 1. Evaluation metrics explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Accuracy is what we usually mean, when we use the term accuracy. It is the ratio of number of correct predictions (True Positives + True Negatives) to the total number of input samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Accuracy = \\frac{True Positives + True Negatives}{TotalExamples}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logarithmic loss\n",
    "Logarithmic Loss or Log Loss, works by penalising the false classifications. It works well for multi-class classification. When working with Log Loss, the classifier must assign probability to each class for all the samples. Suppose, there are N samples belonging to M classes, then the Log Loss is calculated as below :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Logarithmic Loss = \\frac{-1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{M} y_{i_j} \\times log(p_{i_j})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "A confusion matrix is a matrix representation of the prediction results of any binary testing that is often used to describe the performance of the classification model (or “classifier”) on a set of test data for which the true values are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ConfusionMatrix](../imgs/ConfusionMatrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Important terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- True Positives : The cases in which we predicted YES and the actual output was also YES.\n",
    "- True Negatives : The cases in which we predicted NO and the actual output was NO.\n",
    "- False Positives : The cases in which we predicted YES and the actual output was NO.\n",
    "- False Negatives : The cases in which we predicted NO and the actual output was YES.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall or Sensitivity\n",
    "Recall or Sensitivity gives us the True Positive Rate (TPR), which is defined as TP / (FN+TP). True Positive Rate corresponds to the proportion of positive data points that are correctly considered as positive, with respect to all positive data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ConfusionMatrixSensitivity](../imgs/ConfusionMatrixSensitivity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$True Positive Rate = \\frac{True Positive}{False Negative + True Positive}$$\n",
    "                                                                       \n",
    "### Specifity\n",
    "Specifity gives us the True Negative Rate (TNR), which is defined as TN / (FP+TN). False Positive Rate corresponds to the proportion of negative data points that are correctly considered as negative, with respect to all negative data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ConfusionMatrixSpecifity](../imgs/ConfusionMatrixSpecifity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$True Negative Rate = \\frac{True Negative}{True Negative Negative + False Positive}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Area under curve (AUC)\n",
    "Area Under Curve(AUC) is one of the most widely used metrics for evaluation. It is used for binary classification problem. AUC of a classifier is equal to the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision\n",
    "Precision is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of positive results predicted by the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Precision = \\frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Positives}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### F1 Score\n",
    "F1 Score is used to measure a test's accuracy. F1 Score is the Harmonic Mean between precision and recall. The range for F1 Score is [0, 1]. It tells you how precise your classifier is (how many instances it classifies correctly), as well as how robust it is (it does not miss a significant number of instances).\n",
    "\n",
    "High precision but lower recall, gives you an extremely accurate, but it then misses a large number of instances that are difficult to classify. The greater the F1 Score, the better is the performance of our model. Mathematically, it can be expressed as :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F1 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{precision} + \\frac{1}{recall}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score tries to find the balance between precision and recall."
